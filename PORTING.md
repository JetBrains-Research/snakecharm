# Porting SnakeCharm across IntelliJ Platform releases

One document per port, newest last. Each release section is the engineering rationale for that
port — **what changed and why** — so the diff can be reviewed as a set of deliberate, traceable
responses to platform changes rather than churn.

## 2026.1 — unified PyCharm (build 261)

Branch `update-for-intellij-2026.1`, PR #570.

**Status.** The source port is complete: the plugin compiles and loads against 2026.1, all ~37
source-level API breaks are fixed, `compileKotlin`/`compileTestKotlin` both succeed, and every
test-runtime *crash* blocker is resolved (Kotlin stdlib alignment, the test-data-path layout, and
both `PyTypeShed` helpers-locator crashes). The cucumber suite now **runs** (was 3248/3248
crashing) and the parser golden tests are **green**. The remaining cucumber assertion failures are
**mostly pre-existing on 2025.2, not caused by this port**; the measured branch-vs-master comparison
that establishes this lives in [#570](https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/snakecharm/pull/570),
where it can be kept current as the suite changes.

### Background: PyCharm was unified

- PyCharm Community and Professional were merged into a single product in 2025.1.
- **2025.2 was the last standalone PyCharm Community release.** From 2025.3 on there is one unified
  PyCharm (free core tier + paid Pro tier; the tier is a runtime license state).
- The 2026.1 IDE is distributed only under the **Professional artifact** (`platformType = PY`,
  build `261.x`). There is no `pycharm-community:2026.1`, so building against 2026.1 requires
  switching `platformType` from `PC` to `PY`.

Because the source changes below bind the Python plugin API in 2026.1-only shapes (e.g. `PyType`
as a Kotlin interface), **the built plugin runs only on 2026.1+**. `pluginSinceBuild` was raised
`252 → 261` and the plugin version set to `2026.1.0` (`YEAR.MAJOR` = minimal compatible platform).
Advertising 2025.2 support the binary cannot honour would reproduce the "installs then crashes"
failure mode #569 was rejected for.

### Why not just raise `pluginUntilBuild`? (validated dead end, #569)

The tempting shortcut is to ship the unchanged 2025.2 binary and widen `pluginUntilBuild` to
`261.*` so 2026.1 lets it load (PR #569). **The IntelliJ Plugin Verifier proves this does not
work** — the plugin installs on 2026.1 then crashes at runtime, strictly worse than an honest
"incompatible" rejection. Verified against `PY-261.22158.340` (PyCharm Professional 2026.1):

```
Plugin SnakeCharm:2025.2.3-eap.SNAPSHOT against PY-261.22158.340: 4 compatibility problems
#Access to unresolved class com.jetbrains.python.validation.ReturnAnnotator
  - SnakemakeVisitorFilter.<init>()                → NoSuchClassError
  - SmkReturnAnnotator.visitPyReturnStatement(...) → NoSuchClassError
  - SmkReturnAnnotator (class)                     → NoSuchClassError
  - SmkReturnAnnotator.<init>()                    → NoSuchClassError
```

All 4 hard problems are the removed `ReturnAnnotator` (see source break 2). A metadata-only
widening cannot satisfy them — they require the source changes on this branch.

### Why the port touches so much — one umbrella cause

Between 2025.1 and 2026.1 JetBrains didn't merely bump a version — they **restructured the product
and rewrote the Python plugin**. Every change on this branch is downstream of one of three
structural moves:

1. **The product was unified** (2025.1 merged Community + Professional; 2025.2 was the last
   standalone Community). This forced `platformType` `PC → PY` and re-shaped the Python plugin API
   surface: `PyType` became a Kotlin interface, the standalone `ReturnAnnotator` folded into the
   `final` `PySyntaxAnnotator`, `CustomFoldingBuilder`'s signature gained nullability, etc. → **the
   ~37 source-level breaks below.**
2. **The Python plugin was repackaged as v2 content modules** — its code now lives in
   `.../python-ce/lib/modules/*.jar` and `.../python/lib/modules/*.jar` rather than directly under
   `lib/`. → **the `PlatformLiteFixture` removal, the test-data-path extra directory level, and
   both `PyTypeShed` helpers-locator crashes** (upstream gradle-plugin #2183).
3. **The bundled toolchain was upgraded**: Kotlin `2.3.20` (coroutine `@DebugMetadata` v2) and a
   newer bundled typeshed (single-file stubs became *package* stubs).

### What this branch does (build infrastructure)

- `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` + `gradleVersion`: **Gradle 8.13 → 9.6.0**.
- `gradle/libs.versions.toml`: **IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin 2.7.0 → 2.16.0**; added
  `kotlinPlatform` and `kotlinxSerializationPlatform`, which record what the target platform bundles
  rather than what we would otherwise choose.
- `.java-version`: added, pinning the JDK for jenv/asdf users. It has to move with `javaVersion` on
  every bump, or those users silently keep building on the old JDK.
- `gradle.properties`: `platformType = PY`, `platformVersion = 2026.1.3`, `pluginSinceBuild = 261`,
  `pluginUntilBuild = 261.*`, `pluginVersion = 2026.1.0`.
  - **`PC → PY` costs a compile-time guardrail.** With `PC` the compile classpath was
    `bundledPlugin("PythonCore")`, so a Professional-only Python API used from `src/main` failed the
    build. On `PY` it is `Pythonid`, while `plugin.xml` still declares only
    `<depends>PythonCore</depends>` and we still support IDEA + the community Python plugin. Such a
    call now compiles *and* passes the suite (the Gradle test classpath is flat) and fails only at
    runtime, for those users, with `NoClassDefFoundError`. There is no community 2026.1 artifact to
    build against, so this has to be watched by hand in review.
- `build.gradle.kts`: adapted to plugin-2.16.0 / Gradle-9.6 API changes, plus a runtime-only
  `resolutionStrategy` forcing kotlin-stdlib and kotlinx-serialization to the platform's versions
  (see test break 6, and #587 for the serialization half); also
  declares `bundledModule("intellij.spellchecker")` + `bundledPlugin("tanvd.grazi")` — spellchecker
  was extracted from core into a separate module (and the `SpellCheckingInspection` tool moved to
  the Grazie plugin) in 2025.2+, and we use its API (`spellchecker.bundledDictionaryProvider`).
- `CHANGELOG.md`: added a `[2026.1.0]` section (the changelog plugin's `changeNotes` lookup
  requires a section matching `pluginVersion`, else `patchPluginXml` fails).
- `DEVELOPER.md`: added a JDK-21 command-line build/test quickstart and `platformType`/build-number
  notes for the next platform bump.

### Source-level API breaks — FIXED

1. **`PyType` is now a Kotlin interface** (verified by decompiling
   `intellij.python.psi.jar!/com/jetbrains/python/psi/types/PyType.class`; `getName()` carries
   `@Nullable`). Implementations changed:
   - `override fun getName(): String` → `override val name: String?`.
   - `override fun isBuiltin(): Boolean` → `override val isBuiltin: Boolean`.
   - `getCompletionVariants(...)`: `context` is now non-null; return type `Array<out Any>`.
   - Fixed in `AbstractSmkRuleOrCheckpointType`, `SmkRuleLikeSectionArgsType`,
     `SmkRuleLikeSectionType`, `SmkWildcardsType`, and `SmkSectionNameArgInPySubscriptionLikeReference`
     (`getVariants()` return-type covariance). `PyStructuralType` is still a Java class but its
     `getName`/`isBuiltin` are now seen through the Kotlin `PyType` as properties, so subclasses
     must use `override val` too.

2. **`com.jetbrains.python.validation.ReturnAnnotator` was removed.** The "return outside of
   function" check moved into the `final` `PySyntaxAnnotator`, which batches ~16 internal visitors
   and is run by `PyCompositeAnnotator` **without consulting `PythonVisitorFilter`** (verified in
   bytecode). So neither the old subclass-`ReturnAnnotator` trick nor `PythonVisitorFilter`
   suppression works anymore.
   - **New approach:** a `daemon.highlightInfoFilter` — `SmkReturnHighlightInfoFilter` — vetoes the
     `HighlightInfo` for `ANN.return.outside.of.function` when the `return` sits inside a snakemake
     `run:` / `onstart` / `onerror` / `onsuccess` block (`SmkRunSection` /
     `SmkWorkflowPythonBlockSection`). `HighlightInfoHolder.add()` consults these filters for
     annotation-produced infos, so this is the correct surgical hook. Top-level `return`s in a
     `.smk` file are still flagged, matching the old behaviour exactly.
   - `SmkReturnAnnotator` deleted and removed from `SmkStandardAnnotatorManager`; the
     `ReturnAnnotator` entry removed from `SnakemakeVisitorFilter` (its 3 inspection entries stay
     gated via `PyFileImpl.isAcceptedFor`).

3. **`CustomFoldingBuilder.buildLanguageFoldRegions`** now takes `MutableList<FoldingDescriptor?>`
   (nullable element). Fixed in `SmkMakeFoldingBuilder` (+ its private `collectDescriptors`).

4. **`super` disambiguation** in `SmkSLReferenceExpressionImpl.getType` →
   `super<PyReferenceExpressionImpl>`.

### Test-infrastructure breaks — FIXED

5. **`com.intellij.testFramework.PlatformLiteFixture` was removed.** `PyLexerTestCase` (base of
   `SnakemakeLexerTest`, `SmkSLLexerTest`) now extends `BasePlatformTestCase`; the full test
   application already registers the Python token-set contributors, so the manual
   `initApplication()` / `registerExtensionPoint(...)` bootstrapping is gone.

6. **Kotlin coroutines "Debug metadata version mismatch. Expected: 1, got 2"** crashed the test IDE
   during project setup. The 2026.1 platform bundles **Kotlin 2.3.20**, but our build's older
   kotlin-stdlib was pulled onto the runtime/test classpath and its coroutine stack-trace recovery
   cannot read the v2 `@DebugMetadata` the platform emits. Fixed with a **runtime-only**
   `resolutionStrategy.force` (build.gradle.kts) pinning `kotlin-stdlib{,-jdk7,-jdk8}` to
   `kotlinPlatform` (2.3.20). Scoped to runtime classpaths only (matched case-insensitively, so it
   covers the production `runtimeClasspath` as well as `testRuntimeClasspath` — the shipped plugin
   must not bundle the old stdlib either) — forcing it on the compile classpath would trip the
   compiler's metadata-version check.

7. **Test data path resolution broke** (`SnakemakeTestUtil.getTestDataPath()`). It walked a fixed
   number of parent dirs up from the plugin jar to find the project home; the 2026.1 sandbox added
   an extra directory level (`.sandbox_pycharm/<projectName>/PY-2026.1.3/...` vs
   `.sandbox_pycharm/PC-2025.2/...`), so it resolved to a nonexistent `.sandbox_pycharm/testData`.
   Rewritten to walk up to the nearest ancestor that actually contains `testData` — layout
   independent. This one fix cleared three symptoms: the `FileNotFoundException` parsing failures,
   the `PyLightProjectDescriptor` `MockPackages3` NPE, and the cucumber `snakemake_api.yaml`
   `PluginException`.

8. **`PyTypeShed` helpers-root lookup crashed every type-inferring test — fixed (two locators, two
   mechanisms).** `PyTypeShed.getDirectory` → `PythonHelpersLocator.getHelpersRoots` iterates
   **every** registered helpers locator with **no exception guard**, so one throwing locator kills
   the whole lookup. Each locator's `getPluginDistDirByClass` throws
   `IllegalStateException: .../lib/modules should be lib directory` because the v2 content modules
   live in `lib/modules/*.jar`. Two such locators, fixed separately:
   - **Community** (`PythonHelpersLocatorDefault`) checks `idea.python.helpers.path` first, so we
     set `-Didea.python.helpers.path=<platformPath>/plugins/python-ce/helpers` on the `test` JVM via
     a `jvmArgumentProvider` — but only when that directory actually exists. Only PyCharm
     distributions bundle it; on other platform types (IDEA + the external Python plugin) pointing
     the property at a nonexistent path is worse than leaving it unset, because the locator takes
     the value verbatim and skips the layout check that would otherwise report the problem.
   - **Pro** (`PythonProHelpersLocator`, obfuscated, reads no helpers-path property) is fixed by
     **unregistering just that one locator from the `com.jetbrains.python.pythonHelpersLocator` EP
     in the test JVM only** — at the top of `PythonMockSdk.create`, which is the single point every
     test path funnels through (the cucumber glue calls it directly; `SnakemakeTestCase` reaches it
     via `PyLightProjectDescriptor.getSdk()`). The EP is `dynamic="true"`, so removal is clean; the
     rest of the Pro Python plugin stays intact, so Python resolution still works.

   This is a **test-only** artifact, not a real-user bug: `getPluginDistDirByClass` returns the
   plugin path directly when the class loads via a `PluginAwareClassLoader` (the real IDE case), and
   only does the broken "parent dir must be named `lib`" walk on the flattened gradle test
   classpath. So nothing user-visible is (or should be) changed at runtime.

### Related work & open items

- **Upstream gradle-plugin [#2183](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-platform-gradle-plugin/issues/2183)** —
  the root cause of the helpers-locator crashes (v2 content-module jars on a flat test classpath).
  Still open. The issue we originally tracked, [#2070](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-platform-gradle-plugin/issues/2070),
  was closed on 2026-09-11 **as a duplicate of #2183, not as fixed** — a closed upstream link is not
  evidence the workaround can go. If #2183 is fixed, the EP-unregister workaround (break 8) could be
  dropped; re-check on each IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin bump (`2.16 → 2.17`, the build nags)
  and/or a newer `2026.1.x`.
- **The pre-existing bare-`snakemake`/`MockPackages3` fixture gap** — a missing test fixture rather
  than a port defect, filed as [#575](https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/snakecharm/issues/575)
  with the setup fix in [#574](https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/snakecharm/pull/574) and the
  recipe in `DEVELOPER.md` → Configure Tests.
- **Platform-bundled libraries we also depend on** — `kotlin-stdlib` and `kotlinx-serialization` are
  both pinned to the platform's version and forced onto the runtime classpaths, because on the flat
  Gradle test classpath our copy otherwise shadows the platform's. What that costs when it drifts is
  written up in [#587](https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/snakecharm/issues/587); the checklist
  for re-checking them on a bump is in `DEVELOPER.md` → "Update to new Platform API".
- Related upstream issues touching the resolve/indexing behaviour behind the environmental gap:
