This inspection highlights a rule reference in 'use' definition section or after 'rules.<>'
keyword using weak warning if the name matches one of remote module rule patterns.
For modules imported from a local *.smk file the rule reference will be highlighted as error
if the corresponding target rule is missing in the module.
