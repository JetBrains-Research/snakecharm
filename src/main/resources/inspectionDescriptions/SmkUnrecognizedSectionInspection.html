SnakeCharm provides code insight for many Snakemake specific sections. Sections which were
recently added into Snakemake could be not covered by SnakeCharm. The plugin provides only a basic
support for such sections, e.g. syntax highlighting without code completion and other smart features. Please report about such sections
into <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/snakecharm/issues">https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/snakecharm/issues</a>.
<br>
Also at the moment we cannot differ new section from the spelling errors in valid section names, so it could be typo in your pipeline.
<br>
<br>
In future we will add an option to memorize new section keywords and do not bother your with this inspection warning on every usage,
please track <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/snakecharm/issues/334">https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/snakecharm/issues/334</a> issue.
As an workaround you could disable the inspection or use suppress inspection quick fix.
