Snakecharm provides information on keywords and functions that have been depreciated,
deleted or introduced in particular snakemake versions.
<br>
To properly process deprecation information, the language version in the snakemake settings should be set to the version
that should be used for making checks.
<br>
For example, if specified version is 2.0.0, using any keyword that was introduced after that version will cause error.
Similarly, using keywords or functions that were removed before version 2.0.0 will cause corresponding error.
