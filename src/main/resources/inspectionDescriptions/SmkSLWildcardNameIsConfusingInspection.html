This inspection warns if wildcard name is same as section name. It isn't an error but could be confusing in some cases.
E.g. 'output' in 'shell' section is list of paths from 'output:' section, use 'wildcard.output' if you need access to
the wildcard. On the other hand 'output' in 'params' section is a wildcard name.
